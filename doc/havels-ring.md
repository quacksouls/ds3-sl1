# Havel's Ring

Havel's Ring boosts your maximum equip load, allowing you to equip a heavier
weapon and/or armour set while remaining below 70% weight ratio. The ring is
useful whenever you want to equip a decent armour set to help you tank one or
two hits from a boss while you learn the boss' attack patterns. The ring will be
used to help you grab Toxic Mist.
