## Painted World of Ariandel

Start from the Ariandel Chapel bonfire. Break the bridge and use the broken
bridge as a ladder. Descend the broken bridge and make your way down to the
Depths of the Painting bonfire. _En route_ you will find a Crystal Lizard that
drops a Twinkling Titanite. Do not attack the lizard. Approach it and it would
run off a cliff, thus killing itself. Light the Depths of the Painting bonfire
and locate Birch Woman x 4 past a frozen lake. Be careful of any Great Crabs you
trigger. Kill the furthest Birch Woman in order to reveal a steep ladder. Climb
the ladder and then another steep ladder to reach a Titanite Slab.
