# Raw Broadsword+2

## Cemetery of Ash

There's not much I can say here that you shouldn't already know from your first
playthrough. Run straight for the fog wall and fight the tutorial boss.

{% youtube id="8iQlqv9Zh7Y", title="Titanite Shard x 1 at Cemetery of Ash, Dark Souls III" %}{% endyoutube %}

Notable loots:

-   Ashen Estus Flask. Reallocate your Estus Flask to give you an extra use.
-   Titanite Shard x 1. This is near the fog wall of Iudex Gundyr.
-   Firebomb x 5. Useful against the area boss during phase two because the Pus
    of Man is weak against fire.

## Iudex Gundyr

{% youtube id="i0SzxhvjF14", title="SL1 Iudex Gundyr, Dark Souls III" %}{% endyoutube %}

At the start of the fight, before pulling the coiled sword out of his body, use
the weapon art of the Club to boost your damage output. This boss can be parried
during phase one. To parry, ensure both hands of your character are bare. Parry
the boss, switch to your right-hand weapon, and riposte. Rinse and repeat until
phase two commences. During phase two, a Pus of Man would protrude from the
boss. Throw Firebombs at the Pus of Man.

## Firelink Shrine

Enter Firelink Shrine and place the Coiled Sword to start a bonfire. Exhaust
Hawkwood's dialogue to initiate his quest line. There are three benefits to
following his quest line. First, he would gift you the Farron Ring, useful for
conserving your FP when you perform the weapon art of an equipped weapon.
Second, you can summon him at the Consumed King's Garden to help you clear the
area and fight the area boss. Third, he would be available to be summoned at
Archdragon Peak to help you clear the area.

Notable loots:

-   Estus Shard. Can be picked up early by performing the tree jump. Visit Andre
    to allot your Estus Flask and upgrade it. You should now have five uses of
    your Estus Flask.
-   Twinkling Titanite x 1. Dropped by the Crystal Lizard behind Firelink
    Shrine. Can be accessed early by performing the tree jump. Use Twinkling
    Titanite to upgrade the Irithyll Straight Sword and the Irithyll Rapier,
    useful against bosses that are vulnerable to frostbite.
-   Covetous Silver Serpent Ring. Perform the tree jump to collect this. While
    equipped, each defeated enemy would yield an extra 10% souls.

## High Wall of Lothric

{% youtube id="Sz9MnF8KXuc", title="Rescue Greirat and Light Crossbow, Dark Souls III" %}{% endyoutube %}

The most useful NPC in this area is Greirat because he is a merchant for
consumables, weapons, and ammunition. Rescue Greirat and initiate his quest
line. As you advance his quest line, Greirat would expand his shop to include
more consumables, weapons, and armour sets. You need the Cell Key to unlock his
jail cell. Exhaust his dialogue, accept his request, and he should relocate to
Firelink Shrine. Visit him at Firelink Shrine to purchase the Bandit's Knife and
Light Crossbow and stock up on bolts. The Bandit's Knife serves two purposes.
First, the weapon art of the Bandit's Knife allows you to quickly traverse
swamps and many areas that restrict your movement to snail pace. The Dagger has
the same weapon art and you can properly wield the weapon, unlike the Bandit's
Knife. The second purpose of the Bandit's Knife is to be a means of quickly
bleeding enemies and some bosses, an effect not shared by the Dagger.

As an SL1 character, you have the necessary stats to properly wield the Light
Crossbow. The Longbow is also available near the High Wall of Lothric bonfire,
but at the moment you can't properly wield the Longbow without the Hunter's
Ring. However, the Longbow and arrows can still be used to lure enemies to you
one at a time, conserving bolts in the process because you can carry at most 99
of each type of bolts and arrows. Some arrows and bolts have a limit of 30 or
less. Once you have the Symbol of Avarice and some Rusted Coins purchased from
Patches, consider farming for the Knight's Crossbow. Farm this crossbow from the
Lothric Knight x 4 scattered between the arenas of Vordt and Dancer. You can't
one-hand the Knight's Crossbow, but you certainly can two-hand it. The Knight's
Crossbow outputs physical as well as lightning damage, which is useful because
many enemies are weak against lightning.

{% youtube id="ulkqSO06XTg", title="Titanite Shard x 3 & Estus Shard at High Wall of Lothric, Dark Souls III" %}{% endyoutube %}

Notable loots:

-   Raw Gem. A guaranteed Raw Gem is dropped by killing a Crystal Lizard at the
    High Wall of Lothric, past the Tower on the Wall bonfire and near a Pus of
    Man. More Raw Gems can be farmed by killing the Hollows near the High Wall
    of Lothric bonfire.
-   Broadsword. This will be one of your main weapons for the remainder of the
    playthrough. You can also grab the Claymore, but at the moment you don't
    have the requisite rings to allow you to properly two-hand the Claymore.
    Nonetheless, make a suicide run to grab the Claymore as the weapon can help
    you to deal with many strong enemies.
-   Cell Key. In a room guarded by various Hollows and Starved Hound x 2. Use
    Firebombs to kill the Starved Hounds.
-   Estus Shard. Found on an anvil in the room where the Cell Key is located.
    Talk to Andre to upgrade your Estus Flask to six uses.
-   Titanite Shard x 6. One Titanite Shard is available at the Cemetery of Ash.
    The other five are picked up at the High Wall of Lothric. Two of the
    Titanite Shard x 5 are guaranteed drops from killing the Pus of Man x 2. Use
    Firebombs to help you safely kill each Pus of Man. With Titanite Shard x 6
    and a Raw Gem, upgrade your Broadsword to the Raw Broadsword+2.
-   Gold Pine Resin x 2. The upcoming boss, i.e. Vordt, is weak against
    lightning.
-   Deep Battle Axe. Can be collected from a Mimic chest. You must two-hand the
    weapon to properly wield it. Use the Mimic to farm for the Symbol of
    Avarice. You should have chosen Rusted Gold Coin as your burial gift and
    have collected Undead Hunter Charm x 2 at the High Wall of Lothric. Although
    Vordt is weak against lightning, he is especially weak against dark. Use the
    Deep Battle Axe to fight Vordt and conserve the Gold Pine Resin for a later
    boss. You will use the Symbol of Avarice to farm for extra upgrade
    materials.

## Vordt of the Boreal Valley

{% youtube id="RCP7IYcBpLg", title="SL1 Vordt of the Boreal Valley, Dark Souls III" %}{% endyoutube %}

Vordt takes extra damage from the Deep Battle Axe because the boss is especially
vulnerable to dark.
