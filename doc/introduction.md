# Introduction

This guide explains how to be over-powered early and helps you survive your
first SL1 playthrough of Dark Souls III. I'm a casual gamer and do not yet know
how to perfectly no-hit each boss fight. Experienced SL1 runners would most
likely skip most of the contents here. Below I share some tips and tricks.

1. Your starting class must be Deprived. Choose "Rusted Gold Coin" as your
   burial gift. You will be given 7 Rusted Gold Coins, immensely useful for
   farming rare items. Several more Rusted Gold Coins are available at various
   locations in the game.
1. Farm the Symbol of Avarice as early as possible. This head piece is
   indispensable whenever you want to farm rare items. The first Mimic is
   located at the High Wall of Lothric, in a room underneath the Lothric Wyvern.
1. Many useful weapons can be one-handed or two-handed once you have collected
   these five rings: Knight's Ring, Hunter's Ring, Carthus Milkring, Scholar
   Ring, and Priestess Ring. A combination of these rings can allow you to
   two-hand various ultra great swords. You must equip the Knight's Ring,
   Hunter's Ring, and the Carthus Milkring to properly two-hand the Astora
   Greatsword. Two-handing the Zweihander only requires the Knight's Ring and
   the Hunter's Ring.
1. Infuse your weapon with a Raw Gem to give you high base (physical) damage
   output. Boost your damage output by buffing your raw infused weapon with an
   elemental resin and/or equip various rings. Two useful rings to grab early
   are Flynn's Ring and the Red Tearstone Ring. The damage output of your buffed
   weapon can be further increased by equipping one of the Clutch Rings. For
   example, if your weapon has built-in lightning damage such as the
   Dragonslayer's Axe, equipping the Lightning Clutch Ring would grant you bonus
   lightning damage. Buff the weapon with Gold Pine Resin/Bundle for extra
   lightning damage. You can even equip the Lightning Clutch Ring and the Fire
   Clutch Ring, while also buffing the Dragonslayer's Axe with Charcoal Pine
   Resin/Bundle.
1. Use a ranged weapon to safely clear areas. At SL1, you have enough stats to
   properly wield the Light Crossbow and the Knight's Crossbow. Equipping the
   Carthus Milkring would allow you to two-hand the Short Bow or the Composite
   Bow. The best bow to have is the Composite Bow because it has a weapon art
   that allows you to shoot multiple arrows one after the other, and you can
   shoot after rolling. The best crossbow is the Avelyn because it can fire
   three bolts at a time, a useful feature to have for chipping the HP of strong
   enemies.
1. Get Havel's Ring as soon as possible. The ring raises your maximum equip load
   so you can equip heavy armour pieces while maintaining a weight ratio below
   70%.
1. The safest strategy to deal with enemies, including bosses, is to bait an
   attack and go in for the punish. You don't have enough HP to tank hits.
1. To tank a boss, cast Tears of Denial and wear heavy armour pieces while being
   below 70% weight ratio. Many of the late-game bosses, and the DLC bosses, can
   one-shot you. Tears of Denial would allow you to tank one hit. Together with
   heavy armour pieces, you can tank at least two hits and survive long enough
   to learn a boss' attack patterns.
1. Use poison and/or toxic to chip the HP of a boss, or a strong enemy, while
   you wait for an opening to attack. Poison Arrows and Poison Knives are useful
   to build up the poison metre of an enemy from a distance. Poison Mist and
   Toxic Mist are ideal for medium range. Dung Pie and Stalk Dung Pie are
   useful, but only if you have plenty of Blooming Purple Moss Clumps. For close
   range, the Poison Rotten Ghru Dagger+10 is the best weapon for rapidly
   poisoning an enemy. The best weapon for poisoning an enemy is the
   Storyteller's Staff because the chip damage of its poison scales with the HP
   pool of an enemy and the poison lasts a long time, longer than Poison Mist.
   As you play through higher NG cycles, the poison from the Storyteller's Staff
   also scales with the current NG cycle. The weapon art of the Storyteller's
   Staff together with Toxic Mist can rapidly drain the HP of enemies that are
   vulnerable to poison and toxic.
1. Learn the weaknesses of a boss. Is the boss weak against a particular
   element? Apply the corresponding elemental buff on your weapon. Is the boss
   vulnerable to bleed? Use the Blood Bandit's Knife+10 or the Blood Warden
   Twinblades+10. Is the boss vulnerable to frostbite? Use the Irithyll Straight
   Sword+5 or the Irithyll Rapier+5 to trigger frostbite, followed by a fire
   weapon (e.g. Black/Firebomb, Fire Dagger+10, or Torch+10) to reset the
   frostbite metre. Can the boss be parried? Use the Small Leather Shield or the
   Caestus to parry. Can the boss be riposted? Use the Hornet Ring in
   conjunction with a Fire Dagger+10, a setup that also works against a boss
   that is vulnerable to backstab.

In general, learn from your mistakes and the experiences of other players. Study
how no-hit runners deal with a specific boss and incorporate their strategies
into your game play. You might find these videos useful. Search youtube for more
videos on no-hit strategies.
